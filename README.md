# Problem Solving Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my problem-solving repository! Here, I store the source code of problems I've solved on various online judges, including CodeForces, Codechef, LeetCode, CSES, and more. I started this repository in December 2023 and aim to solve at least 5 problems per day.

## Statistics

- Total Problems Solved: 700+
- Started: December 2023

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by the name of the online judge, and within each judge's folder, you'll find solutions categorized by problem difficulty or topic.


## Daily Progress

I commit to solving a minimum of 5 problems per day and will track my progress here. This will serve as both a log of my journey and a motivational tool.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, adding solutions, or sharing your insights on any problem. Open issues or pull requests to collaborate!

## Acknowledgments

I draw inspiration from the coding community and appreciate the wealth of knowledge available online. Special thanks to my Seniors, Mentors and Teachers for their guidance.

Happy coding!
